In this project, I estimate topic model by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm applied to the FOMC minutes. 
First, I show how to represent the text as a bag of words and carry out basic operations with text such as tokenization. Then I show how to prepare this text data set in order to extract meaningful information. As such, I remove the words without information content - so called stopwords.  Also, I exclude the most common words in text which generate a lot of noise in the data. Finally, I estimate topic model by LDA algorithm and provide with a time series of topic distribution throughout the period from 1995 to 2019.
